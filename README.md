# HE-Items

This is a collection of items and single player characters to be used with Hero Editor for Diablo 2.

## To Use Character Files (.d2s)

To use the included character files, you only need to copy the .d2s file into your \Diablo II\Save\ folder. Upon entering Single Player in Diablo 2, you can see the character is now selectable.

## To Use The Item Files

Simply import the item by right-clicking in an empty inventory or gear slot and selecting *Import Item From File...* (Ctrl + I)

### You can also save custom items

If you have an item that you modified using Hero Editor, you can right-click that item and select *Export Item to File...* (Ctrl + E)
